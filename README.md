# Auto Email Sender

Automate your email communication using the Auto Email Sender project. This project enables you to fetch data from a Google Spreadsheet, send customized emails to corresponding recipients, and collect response inputs, all in an efficient and streamlined manner.

## Overview

Managing communication and data collection via emails can be time-consuming and error-prone. The Auto Email Sender project simplifies this process by automating the entire workflow, from data extraction to personalized email delivery and response collection.

## Project Setup

### 1. Environment Setup

Setting up the required environment is the first step towards successful automation. Configure permissions for Google APIs such as Google Sheets, Google Drive, and email. You can create API keys or set up OAuth credentials to ensure secure and authorized interactions with these services.

### 2. Python Script

The heart of the Auto Email Sender project is the Python script. This script efficiently retrieves data from the designated Google Spreadsheet and uses it to personalize emails. The script interacts with Google APIs to fetch data, compose emails, and send them to their respective recipients. Moreover, the script is designed to handle the reception of recipient responses, streamlining the feedback collection process.

## Email Customization

### HTML Template

Enhance the visual appeal of your email communication by creating an HTML template. This template serves as the foundation for your email's layout and design. Customize the template to match your brand identity and communication style. You can include dynamic placeholders within the HTML, which the Python script will populate with actual data when sending emails. This customization ensures that each recipient receives a tailored and engaging email.

## Deployment

### Deploy on Render

To make your Auto Email Sender project accessible and scalable, consider deploying it on the Render platform. Render offers an intuitive and user-friendly deployment process for Python applications. By deploying on Render, you ensure that your automated email communication is reliable and can handle various usage scenarios.
